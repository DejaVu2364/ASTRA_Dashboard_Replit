# Astra Intelligence Report: May 2025

## 1. Executive Summary & Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Dr. Mallikarjun, May 2025 reflects a mixed performance on social media. While average engagement remains a point of strength, sentiment requires immediate strategic intervention.

**KPI Comparison (May vs. April):**

*   **Avg. Sentiment:** **DOWN** significantly. May's average sentiment score across all posts is 0.52, a sharp decline from April's 0.35. This indicates a growing wave of negativity surrounding your online presence.
*   **Avg. Engagement Rate:** **UP** marginally.  May's average weighted engagement rate is 0.018, a slight increase from April's 0.016.  While positive, this increased engagement is being driven by negative commentary, necessitating a proactive response strategy.

**Dominant Topics:**

*   **Positive:** Praise for constituency visits and temple inaugurations continues to generate positive sentiment, although at a diminished rate.
*   **Negative:**  Criticism of infrastructure development, specifically roads and water systems, has emerged as the dominant negative theme. Healthcare concerns also contribute significantly to negative sentiment.

## 2. Thematic Deep Dive: Sentiment by Topic

*   **Positive Strongholds:** Religious engagement and cultural events (temple inaugurations: post_id 1260039279013652, 1260876715596575) remain relative strongholds, providing opportunities for continued positive messaging.  Constituency visits (post_id 1260045532346360) also generate positive feedback, though less consistently than in April.

    **Hard Evidence:** Post 1260039279013652 garnered a 0.67 sentiment score with positive comments such as "I wish you a very happy of the temple ceremony.” Post 1260876715596575 saw positive comments despite a neutral overall score.  This localized positive sentiment should be leveraged.
*   **Negative Vulnerabilities:** Infrastructure shortcomings, particularly concerning road conditions (post_id 1275742920776621) and water system failures (post_id 1270139711336942), are fueling negative narratives.  Healthcare access and quality (post_id 1257643402586573) remain persistent vulnerabilities.

    **Hard Evidence:** Post 1275742920776621 addressing road safety attracted a highly negative comment (sentiment not quantifiable but clearly negative) criticizing neglect of the Honnali-Shimoga road. Post 1270139711336942 regarding water systems received multiple pleas for addressing specific water problems.  These direct appeals for action cannot be ignored.  Post 1257643402586573, while having a positive top comment, highlighted the significant issue of hospital conditions in Chigateri.

## 3. Threat Analysis & Emerging Narratives

The most significant threat is the growing perception of inaction on critical infrastructure projects. While praise for your efforts exists, it is being overshadowed by escalating complaints about inadequate roads and water supply. This negative narrative, largely absent in April, has taken root in May and poses a substantial threat to your public image.  Healthcare concerns, though persistent from April, are intensifying, further eroding public confidence.

**Hard Evidence:**  The repeated appeals in comments for action on water system failures (post_id 1270139711336942, 1270986324585614, 1271485664535680, 1276708424013404) and road conditions (post_id 1275742920776621) across multiple posts provide clear evidence of a spreading narrative of dissatisfaction and inaction.

## 4. Strategic Recommendations

*   **Amplify:** Continue highlighting positive engagement with religious and cultural events. Showcase successful constituency visits, emphasizing personal connections made and issues addressed.

*   **Mitigate:** Aggressively address the infrastructure crisis.  Publicly acknowledge the issues, announce specific timelines for road and water system improvements, and provide transparent updates on progress. Create a dedicated online channel (e.g., webpage, hashtag) for infrastructure updates.  Rapid response is crucial to control this narrative.  Regarding healthcare, investigate and address specific issues raised in comments like those on post 1257643402586573 (Chigateri hospital).  Consider publicizing SS Care Trust’s healthcare initiatives.

*   **Opportunity:**  Capitalize on the positive sentiment surrounding education initiatives (e.g., post_id 1275742920776621). Explore online educational campaigns, Q&A sessions with students, and partnerships with local educational institutions to solidify this positive area.  Leverage the comparison with Tumkur's IT sector development (post_id 1279434517074128) to create a vision for Davangere's economic future, thereby addressing concerns about jobs and development.  This can be achieved through online polls, discussions, and expert panels.
